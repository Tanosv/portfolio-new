# Portfolio — Tanguy Osvald

A modern, responsive portfolio website built with React and TypeScript to showcase my work and approach to front-end development.

##  Overview

This single-page application demonstrates best practices in front-end architecture, performance optimization, and clean code structure. Built with a focus on maintainability and user experience, it features reusable components and clear separation of concerns.

##  Features

- **Structured landing page** with smooth navigation and animations
- **Skills showcase** highlighting technical expertise
- **Project portfolio** with dedicated pages for each project
- **Contact form** powered by Netlify Forms
- **Legal & privacy pages** for compliance
- **SEO optimization** with structured data
- **Accessibility-first** design following WCAG guidelines
- **Performance-optimized** with lazy loading and code splitting

##  Tech Stack

- **React** — Component-based UI framework
- **TypeScript** — Type-safe development
- **Vite** — Lightning-fast build tool
- **Tailwind CSS** — Utility-first styling
- **React Router** — Client-side routing
- **React Helmet Async** — SEO and meta management
- **Netlify** — Deployment and forms handling

```

The architecture separates layout components, reusable UI elements, and page logic to maintain a clean and scalable codebase.


##  Performance

Special attention has been given to:
- Clean routing behavior without unnecessary re-renders
- Optimized asset loading and code splitting
