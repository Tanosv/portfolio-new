Portfolio – Tanguy Osvald

This repository contains the source code of my personal portfolio website.

The project was built to showcase my work and reflect how I approach front end architecture, performance and deployment in a real world context.
It is a single page application developed with React and TypeScript, structured with reusable components and clear separation of concerns.

Project Overview

The website includes:

A structured landing page with smooth navigation

A skills section

Dedicated project pages

A working contact form handled through Netlify Forms

Legal and privacy pages

Structured data for SEO

Particular attention was given to performance, accessibility and clean routing behavior.

The structure separates layout components, reusable UI elements and page logic to keep the codebase readable and maintainable.
